# AI-Driven Quality Inspection System

## Description
This project develops an AI-driven system for automating quality inspections in manufacturing environments. By training a machine learning model on images of manufacturing products, the system identifies defects, thereby improving quality control measures. Deployed on AWS SageMaker and interfaced through an API built with Lambda and API Gateway, it delivers real-time inspection results.

## Features
- **Automated Defect Detection**: Utilizes machine learning to automatically identify defects in product images.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Offers immediate results on product quality through an API.
- **AWS Powered**: Leverages AWS SageMaker for model deployment and AWS Lambda + API Gateway for the API service.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting, data preprocessing, and model training.
- **AWS SageMaker**: For deploying the machine learning model.
- **AWS Lambda & API Gateway**: For creating and managing the serverless API that delivers inspection results.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- AWS account
- Basic understanding of Python, AWS services (SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway)

### Setup and Deployment
1. **AWS Configuration**: Set up SageMaker for model deployment, Lambda, and API Gateway for the API.
2. **Model Training**: Train your model using Python; instructions and dataset details are provided.
3. **API Deployment**: Deploy your model on SageMaker and configure the API using Lambda and API Gateway.
4. **Usage**: Submit images to the API for quality inspection and receive results in real-time.
